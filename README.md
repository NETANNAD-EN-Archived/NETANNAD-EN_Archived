## About
In 2003, members of the leaf key bulletin board fed up with the multiple delays of Clannad jokingly proposed the idea of making it themselves. This led to NETANNAD, a dystopian sci fi visual novel with Clannad's characters that released before the actual game

## Description

In the near future, A.D.2265. There is a huge tower above the capital of Japan, Chukyo, called Sumeru. Rumor says people live inside in peace, without competition, kind to each other. Pierces through high clouds, shines black as obsidian.

## Project

This project's goal is to patch the game and translate the 10 000 lines of gamescript and various graphical assets into English
